# LASSO Regression for Renewable Energy Forecasting

**Description:**  
This online group project from MSM-Week 2025 (University of Ruhuna) develops a LASSO regression–based forecasting model for multi-source renewable energy using climate and atmospheric data. Feature selection, regularization, and cross-validation were applied to improve interpretability and predictive performance.

**Tools & Technologies:** R, Python, scikit-learn, pandas

**Data Sources:** Solar PV and wind energy datasets, meteorological variables (irradiance, wind speed/direction, temperature, pressure, humidity)  

**Team:**  
Guided by Dr. (Mrs.) N. A. D. N. Napagoda (Wayamba University of Sri Lanka)
